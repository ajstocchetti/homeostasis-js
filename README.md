# Homeostasis

This project was inspired by an exercise at my first PDC.

The idea is that each animal is trying to be equal distant from its 2 neighbors (its neighbors are the elements before and after it in the array of animals - not the 2 animals closest to it). Note: equal distant does _not_ mean in the middle of.
